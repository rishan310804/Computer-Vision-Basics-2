# Computer-Vision-Basics-2
This repository contains my coursework projects implementing fundamental computer vision and feature extraction techniques in Python:

• Integral image computation from scratch
• Haar-like feature extraction with multiple patterns  
• Texture classification using LBP, BoW, and HoG features
• SVM-based comparative performance analysis on KTH-TIPS dataset

See report.pdf for method descriptions, results, and reflections. Code is in the codes/ folder and figures are in results/.
